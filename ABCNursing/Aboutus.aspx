        Our Story...</h3>
    <p role="article"
        >
        &nbsp; Begins in 2020 when four KSU Information Systems majors were assigned to create a fully functional web application as a Senior project. After an in class brain storming session we were excited to begin the process of building our breast feeding web application, ABC Nursing. </p>
    <p role="article"
        >
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that according to the CDC breast feeding offers health benefits for both infant and mothers and is an important strategy in building healthy communities. It helps reduce the risk of certain conditions such as asthama, type 2 diabetes and sudden infant death in children and hypertension, type 2 diabetes and some cancers for mom. Four out of five babies are exclusively breast fed at birth, but the number decreases as the babies get older. A support network is the best way to encourage mom to continue for as long as she desires. It is our hope that ABC Nursing is a big part of that network. </p>
    <p role="article"
        >
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By logging feeding details in our events page, we hope that the easy to use record systems gives mom the confidence to accurately address any concerns,or give herself a pat on the back for a job well done!&nbsp; The learn page will offer insights into child care. The analytics page allows to mom compare growth and other measures for peace of mind and just for fun! </p>
